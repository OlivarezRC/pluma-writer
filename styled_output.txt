Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for the opportunity to keynote this meeting.

Today we focus on how AI can strengthen investment processes, risk oversight, and collaboration across our financial community.

First, generative AI and advanced analytics may help drive significant reinvention of investment processes by 2026 [E1]. Next, AI-driven systems appear to support real-time risk oversight in investment processes [E3]. Finally, AI appears to support dynamic scenario modeling in investment processes, with generative techniques likely contributing to these capabilities [E1,E3].

This suggests a path toward faster insight and more agile decision cycles.

Modern financial AI systems use multi-stage architectures that combine deep learning with adaptive risk assessment [E2,E7]. These architectures have shown effectiveness in peer-to-peer lending [E2] and appear effective in algorithmic trading environments [E7].

In this regard, we can align smarter models with prudent governance.

For risk management, Bayesian semiparametric SUMS models capture dependencies between processes through joint random effect distributions [E9,E10]. They can leverage Gaussian Graphical Models to analyze correlated processes [E10]. In practice, SUMS frameworks may accommodate portfolio heterogeneity through flexible random effects and could be adapted to address clustering or outliers, depending on implementation and data context [E9,E10]. They may also be adaptable to include relevant covariates where appropriate [E9,E10].

Meanwhile, this points to richer diagnostics and potentially more resilient portfolios.

Multi-objective optimization algorithms appear to systematically balance risk prediction accuracy with return maximization during asset allocation [E4].

In conclusion, the importance of responsible AI adoption is clear for price stability, financial stability, and sound market functioning. Thank you for your attention and support. Maraming salamat and mabuhay.
