Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

It is my pleasure to welcome our international colleagues to this session.

We thank our hosts and partner institutions for bringing us together today.

Our focus is the use of AI models for portfolio management and risk prediction.

Modern AI and machine learning systems adapt to real-time market conditions and integrate behavioral economics principles like prospect theory to model investor decisions more realistically [E1,E2]. These systems address cognitive biases and emotional factors that classical models often overlook [E3]. In empirical studies, they achieve 15.7 percent higher Sharpe ratios and 12.4 percent greater returns than traditional benchmarks [E25].

Reinforcement learning architectures are impactful in this space, with frameworks such as RL-APM using DDPG agents to process OHLCV data and technical indicators for multi-asset management [E23]. Models including A2C, PPO, and DDPG optimize asset weights through Sharpe ratio maximization across both crypto and traditional portfolios [E22]. BBAPT frameworks incorporate investor biases through adjusted reward functions [E26]. Despite implementation challenges in fintech applications [E21], these systems demonstrate improved scalability and risk-aware optimization [E30].

For risk prediction, Bayesian semiparametric models analyze multiple related multi-state processes through joint random effects on transition rates [E7,E31]. Gaussian Graphical Models identify risk clusters in financial systems [E9,E32]. Deep learning architectures such as RNNs and LSTMs enhance predictive accuracy by capturing nonlinear relationships and temporal dependencies in volatile markets [E39,E40]. Explainable AI methods such as SHAP and LIME address interpretability challenges while supporting regulatory compliance in high-stakes settings [E43,E44].

Natural language processing strengthens risk assessment by mining central bank communications, where narrative information from monetary policy minutes impacts all analyzed market yields [E15,E46]. Topics related to domestic demand and inflation expectations are particularly influential [E17,E48]. LDA analysis shows that these narrative elements have greater market impact than numerical forecasts in inflation reports [E16,E35,E49]. Publication lags likely reduce the effectiveness of these reports [E19,E37].

The integration of these AI techniques enables real-time analysis of complex market interactions [E5,E41]. Probabilistic modeling also extends to innovation pathway analysis in R&D allocation [E6]. Flexible random effect distributions in Bayesian frameworks account for clustering and outliers in financial risk modeling [E8,E33]. Semiparametric approaches maintain adaptability to non-stationary market conditions [E34]. Taken together, these advances show AI’s capacity to improve risk-adjusted returns and decision-making transparency in modern finance [E42,E45].

In conclusion, the work before us can guide better choices, clearer communication, and stronger collaboration across markets and disciplines.

Thank you and good morning.
