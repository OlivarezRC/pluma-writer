EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n- **Overall compliance assessment**: **Minor Issues**  \n- **Compliance score**: **92 / 100**  \n- **Key findings**:  \n  - The speech is **neutral on monetary policy** and does not contradict the BSP\u2019s inflation-targeting framework or recent Monetary Board decisions.  \n  - Messaging on **responsible innovation, regulatory sandbox use, consumer protection, data privacy, and systemic risk** is broadly aligned with existing BSP circulars and memoranda on fintech, IT risk management, operational resilience, and financial consumer protection. \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-002.pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-029.pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-033(corrected copy).pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-019.pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020CIRCULAR NO. 1203 (Series of 2024).pdf\u3011  \n  - Minor phrasing issues risk (a) sounding as if the Deputy Governor is **announcing new binding requirements** on AI (explainability) and (b) implying BSP \u201censures\u201d compliance of all AI applications \u201cin finance,\u201d beyond BSP\u2011supervised entities. These can be fixed with light edits.  \n- **Recommendation**: **Revise** (minor, mostly wording clarifications; substance is sound).\n\n---\n\n2. DETAILED VIOLATIONS / ISSUES  \n\n**Issue 1**  \n- **Severity**: Medium  \n- **Category**: Regulatory / Communication  \n- **Location**: Paragraph 3 \u2013 sentence beginning \u201cAny AI system used in portfolio management must be transparent\u2026\u201d  \n- **Issue**:  \n  - The phrase \u201cmust be transparent, explainable, and subject to appropriate human oversight\u201d is framed as a **categorical regulatory requirement**, but BSP has not yet issued AI\u2011specific rules that enumerate \u201cexplainability\u201d as a standalone mandatory standard.  \n  - While the expectation aligns with general BSP principles that boards and senior management must understand and control the risks of technologies used (e.g., IT risk management, consumer protection, operational resilience) \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-029.pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-033(corrected copy).pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020CIRCULAR NO. 1203 (Series of 2024).pdf\u3011, it is safer to present this as a **supervisory expectation** rather than as if a new, codified rule already exists.  \n- **Guideline / Reference**:  \n  - IT risk management and controls for digital services and technologies under Circular No. 1140 and related appendices on e\u2011banking and electronic products (as reiterated in M\u20112024\u2011029 on risk management systems and controls) \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-029.pdf\u3011.  \n  - Financial Consumer Protection Framework (Circular No. 1160) and its implementation memorandum, which stress protection of client data, robust systems, governance, and privacy\u2011by\u2011design, but do not yet prescribe AI\u2011specific explainability rules \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-033(corrected copy).pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-033(corrected copy).pdf\u3011.  \n- **Original text**:  \n  > \u201cAny AI system used in portfolio management must be transparent, explainable, and subject to appropriate human oversight [E5,E8].\u201d  \n- **Recommendation**: Recast as an expectation grounded in existing risk management and consumer protection principles, e.g.:  \n  - **Suggested revision**:  \n    > \u201cConsistent with BSP\u2019s risk management and consumer protection expectations, AI systems used in portfolio management **should be designed to be sufficiently transparent and explainable, and remain subject to appropriate human oversight**.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n**Issue 2**  \n- **Severity**: Medium  \n- **Category**: Regulatory / Legal & Reputational  \n- **Location**: Paragraph 3 \u2013 sentence beginning \u201cThe BSP maintains its commitment to ensuring that AI applications in finance comply\u2026\u201d  \n- **Issue**:  \n  - The phrase \u201cAI applications in finance\u201d is very broad and may be interpreted as BSP asserting direct supervisory remit over **all** AI in the financial ecosystem, including non\u2011BSP\u2011supervised entities.  \n  - BSP\u2019s authority is over **BSP\u2011supervised financial institutions (BSFIs)** and their activities; BSP issuances consistently frame obligations in terms of BSFIs\u2019 responsibilities (e.g., as personal information controllers under the Data Privacy Act and in handling PII in innovative technologies \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-019.pdf\u3011, and in risk management requirements under AFASA and IT risk circulars \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-029.pdf\u3011).  \n- **Guideline / Reference**:  \n  - M\u20112024\u2011019 (Reminders on the Handling of Personally Identifiable Information and Other Sensitive Data), which stresses that BSFIs, as PICs, are **responsible** for compliance with the Data Privacy Act when using innovative technologies, rather than BSP directly controlling every technology \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-019.pdf\u3011.  \n  - M\u20112024\u2011029 (AFASA) reiterates that BSFIs must employ adequate risk management systems and controls to protect client accounts \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-029.pdf\u3011.  \n- **Original text**:  \n  > \u201cThe BSP maintains its commitment to ensuring that AI applications in finance comply with our regulatory framework, particularly regarding consumer protection, data privacy, and systemic risk management.\u201d  \n- **Recommendation**: Clarify BSP\u2019s remit and emphasize that **BSP\u2011supervised institutions** are responsible for compliance, e.g.:  \n  - **Suggested revision**:  \n    > \u201cThe BSP maintains its commitment to ensuring that **AI applications deployed by BSP\u2011supervised financial institutions** comply with our regulatory framework, particularly regarding consumer protection, data privacy, and systemic risk management.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n**Issue 3**  \n- **Severity**: Low  \n- **Category**: Communication Standards / Data & Evidence  \n- **Location**: Paragraphs 2 and 3 \u2013 bracketed references \u201c[E1,E2]\u201d and \u201c[E5,E8]\u201d  \n- **Issue**:  \n  - These look like internal reference markers rather than citations appropriate for a delivered speech, and they are not linked to specific BSP studies or publicly disclosed sources.  \n  - For a Deputy Governor\u2019s speech, references should either be removed (for oral delivery) or, if retained in a written version, clearly identify public sources (e.g., BIS, IMF, peer\u2011reviewed research, or BSP\u2019s own studies).  \n- **Guideline / Reference**:  \n  - BSP communication practice favors clear, non\u2011technical referencing in speeches, and appropriate attribution to BSP or publicly available sources (consistent with the transparency and disclosure emphasis in Circular No. 1160\u2019s consumer protection standards \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-033(corrected copy).pdf\u3011).  \n- **Original text**:  \n  > \u201c\u2026real-time risk monitoring [E1,E2].\u201d  \n  > \u201c\u2026subject to appropriate human oversight [E5,E8].\u201d  \n- **Recommendation**:  \n  - Remove the bracketed codes from the deliverable speech, or replace them with either (a) narrative attribution (\u201cas shown by recent international studies\u201d) or (b) specific publicly-citable documents if this is for a written publication.  \n\n---\n\n3. COMMENDATIONS  \n\n1. **Balanced innovation\u2013risk message**  \n   - The repeated emphasis on \u201cbalancing innovation with prudent oversight\u201d and \u201cresponsible innovation\u201d is strongly aligned with BSP\u2019s posture in circulars and memos on digital financial services, regulatory sandbox, and operational resilience, where innovation is encouraged but anchored on strong risk management and consumer protection. \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-002.pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-029.pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020CIRCULAR NO. 1203 (Series of 2024).pdf\u3011  \n\n2. **Data privacy and consumer protection alignment**  \n   - Explicitly highlighting \u201cconsumer protection\u201d and \u201cdata privacy\u201d as central to AI deployment resonates with the Financial Consumer Protection Framework (Circular No. 1160) and its detailed expectations on protection of client data, privacy\u2011by\u2011design, and information security standards for digital products \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-033(corrected copy).pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-033(corrected copy).pdf\u3011, as well as the reminder on handling PII when using innovative technologies \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-019.pdf\u3011.  \n\n3. **Support for supervisory technology (SupTech) and stability focus**  \n   - The statement that machine learning \u201ccan complement our existing frameworks while maintaining the stability and integrity of our financial system\u201d is consistent with BSP\u2019s broader drive to use data, regtech/suptech, and resilience frameworks to enhance supervision and manage operational and systemic risk \u30104:2\u2020CIRCULAR NO. 1203 (Series of 2024).pdf\u3011.  \n   - The tone is **conditional and non\u2011promissory**, preserving policy flexibility.  \n\n4. **Regulatory sandbox and dialogue with industry**  \n   - Citing the \u201cregulatory sandbox\u201d and \u201congoing dialogue with industry stakeholders\u201d reflects BSP\u2019s established sandbox framework under Circular No. 1153 and related memoranda (M\u20112024\u2011002, M\u20112023\u2011035), which encourage innovative business models and new technologies within a controlled environment, particularly to serve unserved and underserved markets \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-002.pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-035.pdf\u3011.  \n\n5. **Monetary policy neutrality**  \n   - The speech appropriately **avoids references to interest rates, inflation forecasts, or timing of future policy moves**, thus avoiding unintended forward guidance or market\u2011moving signals. This is fully consistent with the requested topic (AI in risk management) and protects monetary policy communication discipline.  \n\n---\n\n4. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS  \n\n### A. Priority fixes (must address before publication)\n\n1. **Reframe AI \u201cmust be transparent and explainable\u201d language**  \n   - Implement the suggested wording under Issue 1 to present explainability and transparency as a **supervisory expectation anchored in current risk management and consumer protection rules**, rather than as a newly codified requirement.\n\n2. **Clarify BSP remit on AI compliance**  \n   - Implement the suggested wording under Issue 2 so the speech clearly refers to **AI systems used by BSP\u2011supervised financial institutions**, avoiding the impression that BSP directly ensures compliance of all AI applications across the entire financial ecosystem.\n\n3. **Remove or normalize internal reference codes [E1,E2,\u2026]**  \n   - Delete the bracketed markers for the speech version, or replace with plain\u2011language attribution if a written version is to be circulated.\n\n### B. Suggested improvements (quality enhancements; optional but beneficial)\n\n1. **Anchor AI expectations explicitly to existing frameworks**  \n   - Consider adding a brief clause to connect AI use to existing BSP frameworks, e.g.:  \n     - After mentioning consumer protection and data privacy:  \n       > \u201c\u2026in line with our Financial Consumer Protection Framework under Circular No. 1160 and our guidance on the responsible handling of personal data and PII by BSP\u2011supervised financial institutions.\u201d \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-033(corrected copy).pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-019.pdf\u3011  \n\n2. **Highlight model risk and operational resilience**  \n   - Add one short sentence acknowledging that AI models introduce **model risk and operational risk**, which must be integrated into institutions\u2019 overall risk governance and operational resilience frameworks, consistent with Circular No. 1203 on operational resilience and IT risk management standards \u30104:2\u2020CIRCULAR NO. 1203 (Series of 2024).pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-029.pdf\u3011.  \n   - Example insertion (after \u201creal-time risk monitoring\u201d paragraph):  \n     > \u201cAt the same time, AI models introduce model and operational risks that must be managed within institutions\u2019 existing risk governance and operational resilience frameworks.\u201d  \n\n3. **Refer to collaboration with other authorities on data privacy**  \n   - To reflect current practice under M\u20112024\u2011019 and the Data Privacy Act, you may add:  \n     > \u201cIn this regard, we expect BSP\u2011supervised institutions to comply with the Data Privacy Act and the guidance of the National Privacy Commission, alongside relevant BSP regulations, when deploying AI and data\u2011driven tools.\u201d \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-019.pdf\u3011  \n\n4. **Optional: brief nod to financial inclusion**  \n   - One sentence noting that responsible use of AI can help expand access and improve suitability of financial products would align with BSP\u2019s financial inclusion thrust, provided you link it to strong consumer protection and data governance.\n\n### C. Alternative phrasings (for clarity and alignment)\n\n- Current:  \n  > \u201cWe believe these tools can complement our existing frameworks while maintaining the stability and integrity of our financial system.\u201d  \n  Suggested (minor enhancement):  \n  > \u201cWe believe these tools can complement our existing supervisory and risk management frameworks, **provided they are implemented with strong governance, robust data protection, and sound risk controls**, thereby supporting the stability and integrity of our financial system.\u201d  \n\n- Current:  \n  > \u201cWe encourage financial institutions to explore these technologies while adhering to sound risk management principles and BSP guidelines on digital financial services.\u201d  \n  Suggested:  \n  > \u201cWe encourage financial institutions to explore these technologies while adhering to sound risk management principles and BSP guidelines on digital financial services, IT and cybersecurity risk management, and financial consumer protection.\u201d \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2024-029.pdf\u3011 \u30104:2\u2020MEMORANDUM NO. M-2023-033(corrected copy).pdf\u3011  \n\n---\n\n5.

  "speech_content": "\nGood morning, esteemed colleagues from the banking sector and financial institutions.\n\nToday, I want to discuss the transformative role of artificial intelligence in financial portfolio management and risk prediction. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas recognizes that AI and machine learning are fundamentally reshaping how we approach investment strategies and risk assessment in the Philippine financial system.\n\nRecent developments show that deep learning models can analyze vast amounts of market data, identifying patterns that human analysts might miss. These AI-driven systems are being deployed for automated trading, portfolio optimization, and real-time risk monitoring [E1,E2]. Financial institutions worldwide are reporting significant improvements in prediction accuracy and operational efficiency.\n\nHowever, we must balance innovation with prudent oversight. The BSP maintains its commitment to ensuring that AI applications in finance comply with our regulatory framework, particularly regarding consumer protection, data privacy, and systemic risk management. Any AI system used in portfolio management must be transparent, explainable, and subject to appropriate human oversight [E5,E8].\n\nLooking ahead, we are exploring how machine learning can enhance our own supervisory capabilities. Predictive models show promise in detecting early warning signals of banking stress and potential fraud. We believe these tools can complement our existing frameworks while maintaining the stability and integrity of our financial system.\n\nThe BSP will continue to support responsible innovation in fintech, including AI applications, through our regulatory sandbox and ongoing dialogue with industry stakeholders. We encourage financial institutions to explore these technologies while adhering to sound risk management principles and BSP guidelines on digital financial services.\n\nIn closing, artificial intelligence represents both opportunity and responsibility. We must harness its potential while safeguarding the interests of Filipino consumers and the stability of our financial system. The BSP remains committed to fostering an environment where innovation and prudence go hand in hand.\n\nMaraming salamat po. Thank you for your attention.\n"
