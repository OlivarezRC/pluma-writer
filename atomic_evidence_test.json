  "summary": "The Transformer neural network architecture introduced a paradigm shift in sequence processing through its unique components and attention-centric design. The key architectural elements include:\n\n1. **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: Transformers employ a stacked encoder-decoder configuration common to sequence transduction models [E13]. The encoder processes all input tokens simultaneously rather than sequentially, enabling parallel computation of relationships through self-attention mechanisms [E2,E12]. The decoder generates outputs using masked self-attention that restricts attention to previously generated tokens during autoregressive prediction [E3].\n\n2. **Attention Mechanisms**: The architecture replaces recurrent operations with scaled dot-product attention as its foundational component [E12]. Encoder and decoder layers are interconnected through multi-head attention that computes attention scores between all sequence positions [E14]. This design enables significantly greater parallelization compared to RNN-based architectures [E15].\n\n3. **Regularization Components**:\n   - **Dropout**: Applied to attention outputs (0.1-0.3 rate) and feed-forward network activations [E4,E9], implemented through layers like `nn.Dropout(dropout_rate)` [E5]\n   - **Attention-Specific Regularization**: Direct dropout on attention weights prevents overfitting to specific token relationships [E6]\n   - **Weight Decay**: Constrains parameter magnitudes across all trainable weights, particularly effective for attention and feed-forward matrices [E7,E10]\n   - **Stochastic Depth**: Randomly bypasses entire layers during training through layer dropout techniques [E8]\n\nThese components work synergistically to maintain the architecture's parallel processing advantages while preventing overfitting [E11]. The complete elimination of recurrent operations in favor of attention-based computation distinguishes Transformers from previous sequence models [E12], enabling state-of-the-art performance across NLP tasks through efficient relationship modeling between all sequence elements [E14,E15].",
